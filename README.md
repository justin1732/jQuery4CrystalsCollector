# Crystal Collector
## Feel the JQuery, Luke

This was the fourth individual project for the University of Denver FullStack Coding Bootcamp.

This app starts using JQuery JS to run math equations and number variables to attempt to influence and change what the user sees in the app. For this one, the number values are randomly assigned to the Star Wars-themed crystals and deduct from the overall score. If the user can make the score go to precislely zero, the user wins. However, if they fail to do so, the user can lose.

## Using the App on Github
This app is deployed at https://justin1732.github.io/jQuery4CrystalsCollector/

## Starting the app locally

For a local version, I recommend using Visual Studio Code. Navigate over to my GitHub repo, located at https://github.com/justin1732/jQuery4CrystalsCollector, click clone, and be sure to type in the following below:
git clone
Then navigate to the HTML file and load it.

## Using this application

Users are presented with four Star Wars themed crystals to click on. When the user clicks on a crystal, a random, but consistent, number deducts from the overall score. If the user can make the overall score go to the precisely zero, the user wins. However, going under zero makes the user lose.

## Technologies Used

This application uses primarily HTML, Basic CSS, and Bootstrap CSS for rendering and viewing the elements. The app uses JQuery and Ajax to translate the information received from the user into a display. Finally, JQuery in Javascript helps run and function the math variables used in this application.
